# TermProject
 
Names: Livia Nursalim, Arya Kumar, Anna Kerber

How to compile and run: We recommend downloading/using an IDE
- Be sure to install a Java run extension compatible with your IDE
- Navigate to the src folder
- Right click on MovieRecApp.java, and select  "Run Java" (Step may vary depending on your IDE/extension, but just make sure you're running MovieRecApp.java)

** TermProject.java is NOT a part of our final code, it was simply a part of the process acting as a blueprint to get our queries and code running.

** Be sure to have ConnectorJ installed and your correct version in the libs folder: /libs/mysql-connector-j-x.x.x.jar (replace the x's)

** We have submitted the individual data files as well, but another option (main option) is to join the database as a guest in SQLWorkbench:
How to download the dataset (The datasets are publicly available directly from MariaDB database.)

Open your favourite MariaDB client (MySQL Workbench works/preffered)
Use following credentials:
hostname: db.relational-data.org
port: 3306
username: guest
password: relational
Export "imdb_ijs" database (or other version of the dataset, if available) in your favourite format (e.g. CSV or SQL dump).
